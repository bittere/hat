# Hat
> [!WARNING]  
> Though there are binaries for macOS and Linux, these haven't been completely tested. If you find any bugs, please file an issue.

Hat runs in the background and watches a configurable list of folders for new images. By default, Hat only looks at your `Downloads` folder. When a new image arrives, it automatically compresses it and saves it with as with a `(...)_compressed` suffix in the same folder. Compression quality is configurable.

Hat can work with most common file types, including PNG, JPG/JPEG/JFIF, WebP, TIFF, and GIF. Support for more file types & format conversion is planned.

Hat will always be free and will try to balance being delightful to use but powerful.

All processing is done offline, no data is ever uploaded anywhere.
